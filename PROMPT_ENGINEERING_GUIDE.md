</UML>
```

**Examples**:

- `<UML>Provide a detailed class diagram and data flow description...</UML>`
- `<Architecture>Describe the system architecture and component interactions...</Architecture>`
- `<Design>Create a detailed design document with API specifications...</Design>`

**Why it works**: Forces architectural thinking before coding, leading to better structure.

---

### 3. Explicit Requirements

**Impact**: Essential for feature completeness

```markdown
Requirements:

- [FEATURE_1]: [DESCRIPTION]
- [FEATURE_2]: [DESCRIPTION]
- [FEATURE_N]: [DESCRIPTION]
```

**Example**:

```markdown
Requirements:

- User Authentication: Support login/logout with session management
- Data Persistence: Save data to JSON file with auto-save
- Input Validation: Validate all user inputs with clear error messages
- Multi-user Support: Isolate data between users
```

**Why it works**: Removes ambiguity, ensures all features are implemented.

---

### 4. Constraints & Limitations

**Impact**: Prevents over-engineering or wrong technology choices

```markdown
Constraints:

- [TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINT]
- [ARCHITECTURAL_CONSTRAINT]
- [DEPENDENCY_CONSTRAINT]
```

**Example**:

```markdown
Constraints:

- Single Python file implementation
- Python 3.11+ only
- Standard library only (no pip packages)
- Must run on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- File size under 1000 lines
```

**Why it works**: Guides technology choices and prevents scope creep.

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Vague Requirements

```markdown
Build a good task manager.
```

**Problem**: "Good" is subjective. No specific features defined.

**Fix**:

```markdown
Build a task manager with:

- CRUD operations for tasks
- Due dates and priorities
- Multi-user support
- Data persistence
```

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Context Without Requirements

```markdown
You are building a task manager using Python.
Use modern best practices.
```

**Problem**: Can cause feature regression. No specific features or constraints.

**Fix**: Always pair context with explicit requirements and constraints.

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Assuming Edge Cases

```markdown
Build a task manager with proper error handling.
```

**Problem**: "Proper" is ambiguous. AI might miss important edge cases.

**Fix**:

```markdown
Handle these edge cases:

- Invalid date formats
- Empty task titles
- Duplicate task names
- File I/O errors
```

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: No Quality Standards

```markdown
Build a task manager.
```

**Problem**: No guidance on code quality, testing, or documentation.

**Fix**:

```markdown
The code must be:

- Production-ready
- Fully tested
- Well-documented
- Type-hinted
```

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Missing Role Assignment

```markdown
Build a task manager app.
```

**Problem**: Gets generic code without professional standards.

**Fix**:

```markdown
You are a senior software engineer with 10 years of experience.
Build a production-ready task manager app.
```
