### Prompt 2: Contextual Augmentation

**Prompt Used:**

```
You are building a simple Task Manager App for two users in a single Python file.
Use Python 3.11 and only the standard library.

The app should run from the command line and allow users to:
- Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- Assign due dates and priorities
- View all tasks belonging to each user separately

Store all data in memory using appropriate data structures (e.g., lists or dictionaries).
Ensure the program starts cleanly and provides a simple text-based interface.
Include clear function separation for core features (e.g., add_task, edit_task, list_tasks).
The code should be readable, well-commented, and fully functional without external dependencies.
```

**Results:**

- ✅ **Lines of Code**: 321
- ✅ **Classes**: 2 (Task, TaskManager)
- ✅ **Functions**: 15
- ❌ **Data Persistence**: In-memory only
- ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Basic
- ⚠️ **Documentation**: Moderate

**Strengths:**

- Better function separation
- Improved code organization
- More comments

## 💡 Recommendations for IS2238

### For Developers Using AI Assistants:

1. **Always assign a role** - "You are a senior X engineer"
2. **Request design before code** - UML, architecture, data flow
3. **Be explicit about constraints** - File structure, dependencies, versions
4. **List edge cases upfront** - Don't assume the AI will think of them
5. **Specify quality standards** - Testing, documentation, error handling
6. **Use structured tags** - `<UML>`, `<Code>`, `<Tests>` for clarity

### For Researchers:

1. **Prompt engineering significantly impacts output quality** (68% → 95%)
2. **Role prompting triggers professional standards** (+10% improvement)
3. **Design-first approach yields best results** (+7% improvement)
4. **Context alone can cause regression** (65% vs 68%)
5. **Explicit constraints improve robustness** (+13% improvement)

### For Educators:

1. Teach students to **engineer prompts systematically**
2. Emphasize **role assignment** and **structured requests**
3. Show how **incremental prompt refinement** improves output
4. Demonstrate the **cost of vague prompts** (lost features)
5. Encourage **design-before-code** thinking

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that **prompt engineering is not optional**—it's essential for quality AI-generated code. The difference between a basic prompt and a well-engineered prompt is:

- **251% more code complexity**
- **189% more functions**
- **200% more classes**
- **Complete test coverage** (0% → 100%)
- **Comprehensive documentation** (0 → 3 files)
- **27% higher quality score** (68% → 95%)

The optimal approach combines:

1. **Role assignment** (expert persona)
2. **Design-first thinking** (UML before code)
3. **Explicit requirements** (features, constraints, edge cases)
4. **Quality standards** (testing, documentation, error handling)
5. **Structured requests** (tags for clarity)

**Final Insight**: AI assistants are capable of producing production-ready, enterprise-quality code—but only when prompted with the same level of detail and structure you would provide to a senior engineer on your team.
